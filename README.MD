# CompareLists

A simple program to compare two files that both contain newline-delimited lists. Optionally, have the items that are the same between the files output to a separate file.

## Usage

```
CompareLists.exe <listfile1> <listfile2> [outlistfile]

Each value in the listfiles should be on its own line.
If outlistfile is provided, the items in both lists will be written there.
```
